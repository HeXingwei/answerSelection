# answerSelection
Answer selection is a very important task in domain question answering. However, because of the words difference and expression variety 
between questions and answers, there exists the lexical gap between questions and answers, which is the major challenge in question answer
matching. In this work, in order to overcome the lexical gap, we propose an attention based bidirectional gated convolutional neural tensor
network (ABiRCNN+NTN) to imporve the representations for both questions and answers and model their interactions with a neural tensor 
network. We carry out large-scale experiments one answer selection dataset, InsuranceQA and  achieve new state-of-the-art results on 
InsuranceQA dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our model can effectively capture the complex semantic relations between 
questions and answers and encode the questions and answers in more effective way.
